            <p>Alias: Captain Cluck</p>
            <p>Species: Gallus gallus domesticus (But don’t tell her that. She prefers “Avian Avenger.”)</p>

            <h3>The Origin of a Hero</h3>
            <p>Captain Cluck wasn’t always the feathered force she became. Born the runt of her clutch on a quiet free-range farm, Henrietta was small, scrappy, and relentlessly curious. One fateful stormy night, after sheltering a brood of hatchlings from a downed power line, she was struck by a surge of pure energy—and transformed.</p>
            <p>When she woke, she had the strength of ten roosters, the ability to glide short distances with astounding agility, and a mind sharper than any beak on the farm. From that day forward, Henrietta became something more.</p>
            <p>She became Captain Cluck.</p>

            <h3>Powers & Abilities</h3>
            <p>Ultra Scratch Strength – Her claws can dig through solid concrete (and the toughest corn).</p>
            <p>Feather Shield – With a flap of her wings, she creates a gust strong enough to deflect most projectiles.</p>
            <p>The Peck of Justice – A high-speed, beak-first dive that sends villains flying.</p>
            <p>Eggsplosive Orbs – Don’t ask how she lays them, just run.</p>
            <p>Unbreakable Courage – When the coop’s in trouble, she never backs down.</p>
        </div>

            <h3>A Legacy Etched in the Nest of Time</h3>
            <p>Captain Cluck’s heroics are known across barnyards and boardrooms alike. She ended the Great Fox War of '22, brought peace to the Poultry Union, and once stared down a hawk without blinking.</p>
            <p>But her greatest act? Sacrificing her safety to save a transport truck full of orphaned chicks during the Grain Heist of Greendale. She disappeared into the clouds that day—last seen riding the tailwind of destiny.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>“She wasn’t just a chicken. She was our chicken.”</p>
        <p>The world may never see another like Captain Cluck. Though she’s gone, her wingspan stretches across our hearts.</p>
        <p>May her spirit live on in every underdog… and every egg with potential.</p>
